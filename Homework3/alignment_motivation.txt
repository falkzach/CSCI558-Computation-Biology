A pairwise sequence alignment is the alignment of two sequences; DNA, protein. Alignments are looking for homologous regions, areas that are the same or very similar. These are interesting to computational biologists because they can reconstruct the history of evolution and help find the causes of various diseases. A sequence alignment will consist of a series of characters that exist in each sequence in the same order possibly with gaps or insertions, though not necessarily in the same location. There is however also the possibility of alignments happening by random chance, introducing false alignments. These things make finding relevant alignments quite a challenge. As a result, significant effort has been put into improving the algorithms used and the statistical models they user for scoring. These alignment tools have potential outside of biology as well however, including diff tools, plagiarism checkers, and speech recognition.
