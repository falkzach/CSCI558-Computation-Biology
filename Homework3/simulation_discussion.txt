In simulate.py we generate 100000 pairs of random 100 character sequences from an alphabet of 4 characters, sequenced each pair using the local scoring criteria. From the results we generate a histogram simulated.png. This resulting histogram is moderately right skewed centered about 55 with a min around 10 and a max at about 100. The strong peak of local scores for unrelated sequences is not unexpected however. With such a short alphabet the probability of any pair of characters matching is not that low. In a sequence of 100 characters this gives us plenty of opportunities for random walks of matches and the local score dynamic programming algorithm will give us the best of these for any pair of sequences. It is important to be aware of these probabilities for random matches when performing real alignments.
