## seqstats.py
Written for python 3
Note that it may also be desirable to make the file executable depending on how you prefer to call your script.

### Make the file executable as a script
  chmod +x seqstats.py

### Execute
If the file is executable:

  ./seqstats.py -i sequences.fa

If the file is not executable or the python environment is not configured correctly:

  python3 seqstats.py -i sequences.fa
